    <ul>-Using CSS2, for rounded borders, coding the css styles were complex.</ul>
    <ul>-CSS 2, splitting text into multiple columns required complex coding because the standard was not equipped enough to break the text into columns so that it would fit into a box.</ul>
    <ul>-CSS 2 Doesn't support the Border- Box property.</ul>
    <li>-CSS-3</li>
    <ul>-Both CSS and HTML were put into a single file, there was no concept of modules before.</ul>
    <ul>-There were no new ways of writing the CSS rules.</ul>

    <ul>-CSS3 has the capability to split text into various columns so that each text block appears as a layout of the newspaper.</ul>
    <ul>-CSS3 supports the Border-Box property.</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-4 Name a few CSS style components.</h3>
    <ul> -Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size , width , background-color.</ul>
    <ul> -Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-5 What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
    <ul>-The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-6 How can the background color of an element be changed? </h3>
    <ul>-To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-7 How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h3>
    <ul>-In this article, we will see how an image repetition of the backup is controlled in CSS. This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.</ul>
    <ul>-The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-8 What is the use of the background-position property? </h3>
    <li>-The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. The position is relative to the position layer set by </li>
    <br>
    <ul>-background-position: top;</ul>
    <ul>-background-position: left;</ul>
    <ul>-background-position: center;</ul>
    <ul>-background-position: 25% 75%;</ul>
    <ul>-background-position: bottom 50px right 100px;</ul>
    <ul>-background-position: right 35% bottom 45%;</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-9 Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
    <li>-The background-attachment CSS property sets whether a background image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls with its containing block.</li>
    <br>
    <ul>-background-attachment: scroll;</ul>
    <ul>-background-attachment: fixed;</ul>
    <ul>-background-attachment: local;</ul>
    <ul>-background-attachment: local, scroll;</ul>
    <ul>-background-attachment: scroll, local;</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-10 Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
    <li>-There are two reasons behind this:-</li>
    <br>
    <ul>-It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</ul>
    <ul>-Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-11 How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
    <ul>-To horizontally center a block element (like div), use margin: auto;</ul>
    <ul>-Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.</ul>    
    <br>
    <h3>Q-12 How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
    <li>-CSS specifications:-</li>
    <br>
    <ul> -MEDIA QUERIES </ul>
    <ul> -SELECTORS LEVEL </ul>
    <ul> -CSS GRID TEMPLATE LAYOUT </ul>
    <ul> -CSS AURAL STYLE SHEETS </ul>
    <ul> -CSS BACKGROUNDS AND BORDERS LEVEL </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>Q-14 What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
    <ul>-Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the [style-style] tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.</ul>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>-The advantages of External Style Sheets are as:-</li>

   <li>-tty</li>
        <ul> -Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities). Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty" media type.</ul>
   <li>-tv</li>
        <ul> -Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available).</ul>
