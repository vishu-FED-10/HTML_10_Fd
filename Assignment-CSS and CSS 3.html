    <h1>Assignment-CSS and CSS 3</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-1 What are the benefits of using CSS? </h3>
     <ul><b>=> There are a number of benefits of CSS, including:</b></ul>
    <ul> <li>1. Faster Page Speed</li>
        More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. 
        CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.</ul>
         <ul>
            <li>2. Better User Experience
            </li>
            CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>3. Quicker Development Time</li>
            With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>4. Easy Formatting Changes</li>
            If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>5. Compatibility Across Devices</li>
            Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible.
        </ul>
        <br>
    <h3>Q-2 What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
    <ul><b>=> Disadvantages of CSS:</b></ul>
    <ul> <li>1. Confusion due to many CSS levels</li>
        Beginners are more vulnerable to this issue. They might get confused while opting to learn CSS as there are many levels of CSS such as CSS2, CSS3, etc.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>2. Cross-Browser Issues
            </li>
            Different browsers work differently. So, you have to check that changes implemented in the website via CSS codes are reflected properly among all browsers.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>3. Security Issues
            </li>
            Security is important in today’s world driven by technology and data. One of the major disadvantages of CSS is that it has limited security.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>4. Extra Work for Developers
            </li>
            Design services are required to consider and test all CSS codes across different browsers for compatibility. Due to developers testing compatibility for different browsers, their workload increases.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-3 What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h3>
    <ul><b>=> Differences between CSS3 and CSS2:</b></ul>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. each module adds new capability or extends options outlined in CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS3 started around the time of publication of the initial CSS2 recommendation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an exceeding type of pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The new addition of General relation Combinator will be wont to match relation parts of a given part through diacritic (~) combinator.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units. It facilitates styling of backgrounds, borders, boxes, etc…, that permits the USA to stay most of the styling at intervals the computer network and HTML standards and our document, while not a necessity for all those proprietary third-party package packages.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>New values and new units square measure introduced to support all those new properties. for example, Angle units deg, grad, rad, and switch or Time units s and ms.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-4 Name a few CSS style components.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes. Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.21-Feb-2023
        </li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-5 What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</li>
</ul>    <br>
    <h3>Q-6 How can the background color of an element be changed? </h3>
<ul>
    <li>To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</li>
</ul>    <br>
    <h3>Q-7 How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-8 What is the use of the background-position property? </h3>
<ul>
    <li>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
    </li>
</ul>    <br>
    <h3>Q-9 Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
    </li>
   </ul> <h3>Q-10 Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
    <ul><li> enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
    Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.</li></ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-11 How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>With css the way to center anything that's a block level element is with the margin property. One of the values of margin is auto and by setting auto on the left and right margin our block level element will center itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Q-12 How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
    <ul><b>=> CSS specifications:</b></ul>
    <br>
    <ul> <li>MEDIA QUERIES</li> </ul>
    <ul> <li>SELECTORS LEVEL</li> </ul>

    <ul> <li>CSS COLOR</li> </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Q-13 What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.</li>
   </ul>    <br>
    <h3>Q-14 What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.
    </li>
</ul>    <br>
    <h3>Q-15 What are the external style sheets?</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.
        </li>
     </ul><br>
    <h3>Q-16 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file. In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site. In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Q-17 What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</li>
</ul>    <br>
    <h3>Q-18 What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h3>
    <br>
   <li>all</li>
        <ul> Suitable for all devices.</ul>
   <li>braille</li>
        <ul> Intended for braille tactile feedback devices.</ul>
   <li>embossed</li>

   <li>screen</li>
        <ul> Intended primarily for color computer screens.</ul>
   <li>speech</li>
        <ul> Intended for speech synthesizers. Note: CSS2 had a similar media type called 'aural' for this purpose. See the appendix on aural style sheets for details.</ul>
   <li>tty</li>
        <ul> Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities). Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty" media type.</ul>
   <li>tv</li>
        <ul> Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available).</ul>
      <br>  
    <h3>Q-19 What is the rule set? </h3>
    <ul><b>=> collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against to determine an action to take such as forwarding or rejecting a packet, creating an alert, or allowing a system event.</b></ul>
